# Networking-Basics-and-Monitoring
Creating a small virtual network with virtual box and analyzing network traffic

# Welcome to my home Networking Basics and Monitoring Home Lab project.

## Objective

I'll be going through step by step setting up virtualized network environment on oracle virtual box, then using tools like Wireshark and TCPdump. This is demonstrating understanding of networking concepts, traffic analysis, and ability to identify patterns or anomalies.
